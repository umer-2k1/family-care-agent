You provide two short planning docs. The AI turns them into project context,
feature specs, and build steps. You build one feature at a time, review every
spec before code exists, and review every diff before it lands.

Install it inside an already scaffolded Git repository:

```bash
npx ai-genesis-kit@latest
```

## What this is

Vibe coding is describing a vague thing and accepting whatever the AI returns.
It is fast until it is not: you end up with code nobody understands and a project
that cannot be changed safely.

This ai-genesis-kit gives the AI a controlled loop:

1. **Spec before code.** Planning skills write a spec and stop. You review it
   before a single line of code is written.
2. **Small, reviewable steps.** Each implementation step ends with something
   observable, a diff you can read, and proof that the done-when was met.
3. **One work item at a time.** `ai-genesis-kit/context/current-feature.md` holds
   exactly one feature, fix, or rollback. Finish it, archive it, then move on.
4. **Findings with teeth.** Review findings get durable IDs and status in a
   ledger, and a serious finding blocks the merge until a fresh review confirms
   the repair - or you explicitly waive it, on the record. Nothing gets
   silently dropped when the context clears.

The point is not to type less. It is to stay in control of a codebase the AI is
helping you write.

## At a glance

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spec first          | The AI writes a feature or fix spec, then stops for review before code.                                   |

## Quick start

Scaffold the app first, then install the AI Genesis Kit.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- an application scaffolded with the stack of your choice
- a Git repository for that application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scaffold your app first, then install the AI Genesis Kit. Do not run a framework
> scaffolder inside a folder that already contains AI Genesis Kit files.

**1. Scaffold your app** in a new, empty directory. Next.js is only an example
here; use any stack or scaffolder you want:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

Make sure the app is a **git repo**. The build loop works on branches and
squash-merges. Some scaffolders run `git init` for you; if yours does not, run it
yourself:

```bash
git init
```

**2. Add the ai-genesis-kit** from inside the app:

```bash
npx ai-genesis-kit@latest
```

The installer asks which AI tool adapters you want and adds only the AI Genesis Kit
workflow files your app needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing, run `/onboard` before filling in plans or running
> `/overview`. This is the setup pass that makes the AI Genesis Kit match your actual
> project. If Claude Code was already open when the AI Genesis Kit was installed,
> restart Claude Code in that folder so the newly added project skills appear.

**3. Run onboard before anything else.** This detects the stack and may edit the
setup files that ship with the overlay: `AGENTS.md` commands, the `CLAUDE.md`
project title when present, `ai-genesis-kit/context/coding-standards.md`,
`ai-genesis-kit/context/ai-interaction.md`, `.gitignore`, adapter recommendations, and
README placement. It also asks whether AI Genesis Kit workflow files should be
committed or kept local-only through `.gitignore`:

```text
/onboard
```

In Codex, invoke it as `$onboard`. In Claude Code, invoke it as `/onboard`.

**4. Review the setup.** Skim
[ai-genesis-kit/context/coding-standards.md](ai-genesis-kit/context/coding-standards.md) and
[ai-genesis-kit/context/ai-interaction.md](ai-genesis-kit/context/ai-interaction.md). Adjust
anything `/onboard` flagged or anything that does not match how you want to work.
If something feels off, run `/doctor`; it is a read-only health check for the
AI Genesis Kit setup. If the app has logic worth testing but no unit test runner, run
`/tests` now. It is a one-time setup step; future implementation work uses the
configured test command automatically.

**5. Plan the app.** Fill in the two files you own:

- [ai-genesis-kit/project-plan.md](ai-genesis-kit/project-plan.md)
- [ai-genesis-kit/build-plan.md](ai-genesis-kit/build-plan.md)

The project plan can be rough notes. The build plan should become a numbered
checkbox list because the build loop uses checked and unchecked items to know
what is next. If your first pass is just bullets, `/overview` will flag that and
can propose a cleaned-up checkbox version before generating context.

**6. Generate the overview once.** This checks the two planning docs, helps shape
the build plan if needed, then turns them into
`ai-genesis-kit/context/project-overview.md`, the AI-facing source of truth:

```text
/overview
```

Re-run `/overview` only when `project-plan.md` or `build-plan.md` changes.

**7. Repeat the build loop.** Once the overview exists, build one feature or fix
at a time:

```text
/feature
/implement
/check
/audit current
/complete
```

That loop specs the next feature, builds it, proves the behavior, reviews the
changed code, then archives and merges it.

In Codex, invoke the same steps as skills (`$overview`, `$feature`, `$implement`,
`$check`, `$complete`) or ask naturally, such as "run the overview." In Claude
Code, use the slash commands shown above.

### Already have a codebase?

If the app already has meaningful shipped features, use `/adopt` instead of
`/onboard`. Install the AI Genesis Kit, then run:

```text
/adopt
```

`/adopt` surveys the real repo, asks for the intent the code cannot reveal, then
generates the planning docs and coding standards from what already exists. Then
run `/overview` and continue through the normal build loop.

### Keep AI Genesis Kit current

Preview an update before it writes anything:

```bash
npx ai-genesis-kit@latest update --dry-run
```

Then apply it:

```bash
npx ai-genesis-kit@latest update
```

Updates manage only AI Genesis Kit-owned workflow files under `.agents/skills/`,
`.claude/skills/`, and `ai-genesis-kit/README.md`. They do not overwrite `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, project plans, build plans, context, history, references, or
prototypes.

New installs record managed-file hashes in `ai-genesis-kit/.state/manifest.json`. If a
managed file changes locally, the updater reports a conflict instead of silently
overwriting it. An interactive update can back up and replace conflicts after
confirmation. In non-interactive use, pass `--force` to do the same explicitly.
Backups are stored under `ai-genesis-kit/.state/backups/` and ignored by git.

Older installs without a manifest can use the same command. Matching files are
adopted into the manifest, while differing managed files are treated as conflicts.

## Tool support

| Tool                        | Support                                               | Invocation                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex                       | Native project skills in `.agents/skills/`            | `$feature`, `$implement`, or plain language        |
| Claude Code                 | Native project skills in `.claude/skills/`            | `/feature`, `/implement`, and other slash commands |
| Other AGENTS.md-aware tools | Shared project instructions plus readable skill files | Ask the agent to follow the matching `SKILL.md`    |

Install one adapter or both. The workflow state under `ai-genesis-kit/` stays
tool-independent, so a project can move between supported agents without moving
its plan or history back into chat.

## The AI workflow

AI loops are popular because the assistant can plan, act, check the result, and
iterate. This ai-genesis-kit turns that idea into a project workflow with human review
gates and a written history.

The recommended build loop is:

```text
/feature -> review spec -> /implement -> /check -> /audit current -> /complete
```

Use `/try` when you want a manual review path. Use a broader `/audit` scope when
you want to look beyond the current feature. Run `/release` after a completed
feature or milestone when you want Render or Vercel deployment prep.

For unplanned bugs or small changes, use the fix loop:

```text
/fix "what is wrong" -> review spec -> /implement -> /check -> /complete
```

If the cause is unclear, diagnose first without changing files:

```text
/debug "what is failing" -> review evidence -> /fix "confirmed bug" -> /implement
```

To remove a completed feature without erasing its history, use the rollback loop:

```text
/rollback 4 -> review risk + spec -> /implement -> /check -> /complete
```

In this repo, **the build loop** means:

- **`/feature`** selects the next planned feature and writes a buildable spec.
- **`/debug`** reproduces and isolates a failure, then stops with evidence.
- **`/fix`** writes a smaller spec for an unplanned bug or change.
- **`/rollback`** identifies a completed feature's exact commit, checks later
  dependency risk, and writes a guarded reversal spec.
- **`/implement`** builds the current spec one reviewed step at a time.
- **`/check`** runs the real app and proves the done-whens.
- **`/audit current`** reviews the complete feature-branch delta and records
  actionable findings before the work closes.
- **`/complete`** archives the spec, commits the finished work, and merges with
  your approval.

The loop is the control system. The AI can keep iterating, but only inside the
current spec, with observable checks and review gates.

## See it in action

The workflow makes each handoff visible instead of hiding it inside one long AI
conversation:

```text
You: Run the next feature.
AI:  Wrote ai-genesis-kit/context/current-feature.md and stopped for review.

You: The spec looks good. Implement step 1.
AI:  Built step 1, ran its checks, and returned the diff for review.

You: Run the check.
AI:  Verified each done-when and reported the evidence.

You: Audit the current feature.
AI:  Reviewed the branch delta and recorded any actionable findings.

You: Complete it.
AI:  Ran the final gate, archived the spec, and asked before merging.
```

## Visual overview

The diagram shows the fresh-project workflow. `/overview` happens after planning
and only re-runs when the plans change. The repeating loop starts at `/feature`
or `/fix`, then moves through implementation, proof, manual review, audit,
completion, and history. For an existing codebase, use `/adopt` instead of
`/onboard`.

## The two files you own

| File                                                             | What it is                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ai-genesis-kit/project-plan.md](ai-genesis-kit/project-plan.md) | The **what and why**: problem, users, features, data, tech, monetization, and UI/UX. Answer each section in a line or two. |
| [ai-genesis-kit/build-plan.md](ai-genesis-kit/build-plan.md)     | The **ordered feature list**: one line per feature, in rough build order. No deep detail here.                             |

These two files are the inputs you maintain. Draft them yourself or with the AI.
Your job is to decide and own what goes in them. The AI can help with wording,
expansion, and tradeoffs.

The build plan is a living roadmap, not a frozen record of the initial MVP. Keep
completed items checked and add new unchecked features as the project grows.
Milestone headings such as `## MVP` and `## Post-MVP` can separate phases without
changing how `/feature` finds the next item. Keep completed feature numbers
stable because archived specs refer back to them.

When adding an incremental feature, `build-plan.md` is usually the only planning
file that changes. Update `project-plan.md` too when the feature changes the
product direction, users, data, stack, monetization, UI/UX, or deployment. Then
re-run `/overview` before feature work so generated context stays current.

You can make those edits directly. You can also run `/feature "new capability"`.
If no existing item matches, the skill proposes a feature-sized build-plan line,
any necessary project-plan edits, and its placement. After you approve the plan
change, it refreshes the overview and continues by writing the feature spec.

> [!TIP]
> Keep these files short and decisive. The overview step will turn them into more
> concrete project context.

Fix the planning docs, then regenerate. Do not hand-edit generated context unless
the skill tells you to.

> [!WARNING]
> Treat generated context as downstream output. When the plan changes, update the
> planning docs and re-run the relevant skill instead of patching generated files

## Using the workflow

After `/onboard` and after filling in the two planning docs, run `/overview`. It
checks that the plans are usable, proposes a normalized checkbox build plan if
needed, distills the docs into `ai-genesis-kit/context/project-overview.md`, and
reports contradictions or gaps under **Open questions**. Answer those questions
in the plans, then re-run `/overview`.

If you are unsure whether setup is complete, the plans are ready, or the overview
is current, run `/doctor`. If setup is healthy and you just need to know where
the build loop stands, run `/status`.

Then repeat the build loop for each feature:

1. Optionally run **`/brief`** first to preview what the next feature involves -
   scope, dependencies, size - without writing anything. Then run **`/feature`**
   to spec the next unchecked build-plan item. You can also pass a number or name,
   such as `/feature 3` or `/feature "login"`. If the named feature is genuinely
   new, `/feature` offers to add it to the living build plan and refresh the
   overview before spec'ing it.
2. Review `ai-genesis-kit/context/current-feature.md` before code is written.
3. Run **`/implement`**. It branches, builds one step, shows the diff, proves the
   done-when, and waits for approval before moving on.
4. Run **`/check`** when you want an outside proof pass against the real app.
5. Run **`/try`** when you want the manual review path: where to go, what to
   click or run, and what to expect.
6. Run **`/audit current`** to review the complete feature-branch delta before
   closing the work. Resolve or explicitly disposition its findings first.
7. Run **`/complete`** when the feature is done. It archives the spec, checks off
   the build plan, commits the finished work, and squash-merges with your
   go-ahead. After the merge, it must ask separately before pushing main.
8. Optionally run **`/release render`** or **`/release vercel`** when you want
   local deployment config and a provider-specific readiness check.

### Fixes

Use `/fix` instead of `/feature`:

```text
/fix "password reset email never sends"
```

If you already described the problem in chat, `/fix` can use that context. It
needs an argument or clear problem statement; it does not scan the app and
magically know what to fix.

Then continue with `/implement`, `/check`, and `/complete`. Fixes are logged to
`ai-genesis-kit/history/fixes/` and do not change `build-plan.md`.

### Rollbacks

Use `/rollback` when a completed feature needs to be removed:

```text
/rollback 4 because the export flow is corrupting files
```

The command matches the checked build-plan item to its archived spec and the git
commit that added that archive. It separates product files from protected
AI Genesis Kit files, reviews later commits for dependency risk, then writes a
`Type: Rollback` spec and stops. After review, `/implement` applies only the
feature's product diff in reverse on a `rollback/` branch. It does not run a
whole-commit revert that would delete the original archive or overwrite current
planning state.

Run `/check` to prove the removed behavior is gone and an unaffected regression
path still works. `/complete` adds a separate record under
`ai-genesis-kit/history/rollbacks/`, unchecks the original build-plan item, and merges
only with approval. It never rewrites git history or silently cascades into later
features.

These commands are the structured path, not a cage. You can describe a feature,
fix, or change directly in chat at any time. Use the skills when you want the
repeatable loop, review gates, and history.

### Autopilot

`/autopilot` or `$autopilot` is an explicit opt-in mode for one bounded pass. It
can pick or resume a feature, write the spec when needed, implement small steps,
run build/tests/checks, create checkpoint commits on the feature branch, and
self-review the diff. It then runs a targeted audit of the active feature and
affected code, repairs confirmed P0/P1 findings that remain within scope, reruns
the affected checks, and stops with a review packet. Broader project cleanup
remains a separate `/audit` followed by planned `/fix` work.

Autopilot does not replace the normal workflow. `/feature`, `/implement`,
`/check`, and `/complete` remain the conservative default.

Autopilot always stops before `/complete`, merge, push, deploy, publish, send,
destructive actions, or any action that needs a product decision not covered by
the docs.

## Automatic GitHub checks

Automatic GitHub checks are a separate optional setup. `/onboard` and `/adopt`
only report existing checks and point here. After either setup, run:

```text
/ci
```

In Codex, invoke the same skill as `$ci`.

This is the simple mental model:

- **Verify is the recipe.** It is one local command that runs the checks this
  project already has, in order: typecheck, tests, then build.
- **GitHub Actions is the worker.** It runs that same recipe when a pull request
  is opened or code reaches the default branch.
- **A GitHub ruleset is the lock.** If you later require the check in GitHub, a
  pull request cannot merge until the worker reports green.

The recipe does not turn checks on by magic. If the project has typechecking and
a build but no test runner, a JavaScript project might start with:

```json
"verify": "npm run typecheck && npm run build"
```

After you deliberately run `/tests`, the same recipe might become:

```json
"verify": "npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build"
```

`npm run build` still works normally either way. The Verify command simply gives
the agent and GitHub one shared command so they do not disagree about what
"checked" means.

When `/ci` runs, the agent detects the real stack, package manager, install
command, default branch, and any existing workflows. It creates or reuses one
project-specific Verify command, documents it in `AGENTS.md`, and
adds `.github/workflows/verify.yml` only when that does not overwrite existing
CI. Existing workflows are preserved and overlap is reported for review.

The `/ci` setup stops there. It does not add git hooks, coverage thresholds,
browser tests, security scanners, dependency matrices, or a required GitHub
ruleset. Experienced teams can add those later. Skipping `/ci` does not disable
builds, tests, or the AI Genesis Kit workflow.

## Testing

Testing is opt-in. The ai-genesis-kit installs no test runner because it does not know
your stack, but adding one is a normal workflow task.

> [!NOTE]
> Tests become a required gate only after you add a real `test` command to the
> Commands section of `AGENTS.md`.

To add unit testing, run:

```text
/tests
```

The agent should pick the stack-native runner, reuse an existing runner if one is
already present, wire the scripts or commands, add a small example test, and
update the **Commands** section of `AGENTS.md`. For a TypeScript app that usually
means Vitest; Python might use pytest, and Go already has `go test`.

`/tests` is a setup command, not a product feature. It should not try to write a
broad test suite for existing code. It proves the runner works, documents the
command, and turns on the testing gate for future logic-bearing work.

Once a runner is configured, tests become a gate for logic-bearing steps:
parsers, validators, server actions, formatters, and similar work should include
a passing test in the same diff. UI and integration work can ride on screenshot,
browser, build, or API evidence from `/implement` and `/check`.

For browser-heavy work, Playwright is preferred when the project already has it
installed or declares a Playwright command. The ai-genesis-kit does not install it by
default; adding browser automation is a normal setup task when a project wants
that level of verification.

## Code quality audits

`/check` proves the app does what the spec promised. `/audit` reviews the code
itself.

Autopilot applies the targeted `/audit current` behavior before producing its
review packet. It validates findings, repairs confirmed P0/P1 issues within the
approved feature scope, and reruns the affected checks. It does not turn a
feature pass into a repository-wide cleanup.

Run `/audit` directly when you want a separate read-only review, a broader
project audit, or a focused quality, security, performance, or tests pass. A
broad audit looks for duplicated logic, dead code, unused exports, overgrown
modules, inconsistent patterns, missing tests for logic-bearing code, security
risks, performance risks, and drift from `coding-standards.md`.

Scope and lens are separate controls, and they can appear in either order:

```text
/audit current                  # All lenses across the active work
/audit quality changed          # Maintainability and standards in local changes
/audit security current         # Trust boundaries across the active work
/audit performance src/api      # Runtime risks in one subsystem
/audit tests src/auth           # Test gaps and test quality in one subsystem
/audit full                     # All lenses across the full project
```

With no argument, Audit uses `current` when a feature is active, `changed` when
local changes exist, and `full` otherwise. The `current` scope includes committed
checkpoint work from the feature branch's merge base through `HEAD`, so a clean
working tree does not hide completed Autopilot steps. The `full` scope excludes
dependencies, generated files, build and coverage output, caches, vendored code,
and minified assets unless you explicitly include them.

With no lens, Audit reviews quality, security, performance, and tests together.
A focused lens runs only relevant signals and states which concerns were not
reviewed, so a security-only pass is never presented as a broad audit.

Confirmed P0 and P1 findings require a concrete code path, violated contract or
security boundary, failing check, or reproducible behavior. Unconfirmed concerns
are reported separately as risks. Audit reports its commit range, reviewed and
excluded paths, unavailable checks, runtime evidence, and whether full-project
coverage was complete. Suspected secrets are always redacted and never copied
into the report.

### The findings ledger

Findings live in `ai-genesis-kit/context/findings.md`, not just chat, so they
survive a context clear. Each gets a durable ID (`F-01`), a severity, and a
status:

| Status   | Meaning                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `open`   | Confirmed, not yet repaired    |
| `fixed`  | Repaired, waiting on re-review |
| `closed` | Repaired and re-reviewed       |

`/complete` refuses to merge while any P0 or P1 finding is `open` or `fixed`:
a repair does not clear the gate until a review has looked at the result,
because a fix can introduce a worse defect than the one it removed.
`/implement` repairs open findings as extra reviewed steps, `/fix F-03` picks
one up between work items, and a finding clears without code only through your
explicit `accepted` (reason recorded) or an `invalid` verdict backed by
re-review; an agent never waives its own findings. Resolved findings archive with the work item
under `ai-genesis-kit/history/`. The ledger reports status; it never becomes the
checklist a review scopes to.

Beyond the ledger, `/audit` does not edit files, install tools, commit, merge,
or push. Full lifecycle details live in the
[findings ledger docs](https://github.com/umer-2k1/ai-genesis-kit).

## Manual try guides

`/check` is the agent proof pass. `/try` is the human review path.

Run `/try` when you want to know what to start, where to go, what to click or
run, what to expect, and what would count as wrong. It reads the active feature
spec when a feature is in progress, or the latest archived feature after
`/complete`.

`/try` is read-only. It does not run the app unless you explicitly ask for that.

## Deployment readiness

`/release` prepares a project for Render or Vercel without making deployment an
automatic part of the build loop.

Use it after a feature or milestone is complete:

```text
/release render
/release vercel
```

It reads the project plans, app commands, package files, and existing provider
config. It can create or update local files such as `render.yaml`, `vercel.json`,
or `.env.example` when the target is clear. It also runs local build/test/start
checks where possible and ends with the env vars, smoke-test path, blockers, and
next provider step.

`/release` must stop before deploy, remote service creation, remote env changes,
push, publish, or any external action unless you explicitly approve that action
in the current chat.

## Picking up where you left off

You do not need a separate save/load command. The ai-genesis-kit keeps project state
in files, not the conversation:

- `ai-genesis-kit/context/project-overview.md` is the source of truth.
- `ai-genesis-kit/context/current-feature.md` is the in-progress spec.
- `ai-genesis-kit/build-plan.md` says what is done and what is next.
- `ai-genesis-kit/history/` plus git keeps the build history.

You can clear context any time. Between features, run `/feature` for the next
item. Mid-feature, run `/implement` again and it resumes from the first unchecked
step in `current-feature.md`.

> [!TIP]
> If you are unsure what to do next, run `/status`. To understand what a specific
> upcoming feature involves before spec'ing it, run `/brief`. If you are unsure
> whether the AI Genesis Kit is set up correctly, run `/doctor`. All three are read-only.

`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`, and `.claude/` stay at the repo root
because the tools that read them look there. Everything else owned by the
workflow lives under `ai-genesis-kit/`, so it stays out of your app code.

This file map shows the portable, committed layout. During `/onboard`, you can
choose local-only mode instead. That keeps `AGENTS.md` public as a lightweight
project guide, but adds this to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# AI Genesis Kit local workflow files
.agents/
.claude/
ai-genesis-kit/
CLAUDE.md
```

In local-only mode, `/onboard` should keep public `AGENTS.md` focused on project
description, commands, testing status, and conventions, not the hidden workflow
docs or skill list.

Local-only mode keeps the workflow contents out of the repo, but it is not
portable by itself. Another machine needs the AI Genesis Kit reinstalled or restored
locally. If those paths were already committed, `.gitignore` is not enough; you
must explicitly approve untracking them with `git rm --cached` while keeping the
local files.

When editing shared workflow behavior, keep the matching files in `.agents/skills`
and `.claude/skills` aligned. Tool-specific invocation text is fine, but the
actual build loop should stay the same across both adapters.

## Notes

### This is not an app skeleton

The installed AI Genesis Kit overlay does not add a project-level `package.json`.
Scaffold the app first with whatever stack you like, then install these files.
That keeps the workflow stack-agnostic: the same process can guide a Next.js
app, a Vite SPA, a Python service, or something else.

The defaults in `coding-standards.md` assume Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and
Prisma. Change them to match your project. To keep the install low-conflict, the
ai-genesis-kit avoids root files a framework scaffold usually creates, like
`.gitignore`, `package.json`, lockfiles, `tsconfig.json`, or `eslint.config.mjs`.

### Prototyping is separate

Locking the look with mockups, Figma, v0, or static HTML is exploratory work. Do
it before the build loop and let the result inform the UI/UX section of your
project plan. The `/prototype` helper can create throwaway static mockups in
`prototypes/`.

### Works in other tools

The ai-genesis-kit is not Claude-specific. `AGENTS.md` is the cross-tool entry point,
`.agents/skills` exposes the workflow to Codex, and `.claude/skills` exposes it
to Claude Code.

You do not have to keep both adapters. For Codex-only work, keep `AGENTS.md`,
`.agents/`, and `ai-genesis-kit/`. For Claude Code-only work, keep `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, and `ai-genesis-kit/`. Keep both adapters if you switch
between tools.

Use the native invocation style for your tool:

- Codex: `$onboard`, `$doctor`, `$adopt`, `$overview`, `$brief`, `$feature`,
  `$debug`, `$fix`, `$tests`, `$ci`, `$implement`, `$check`, `$try`, `$audit`, `$rollback`, `$complete`,
  `$release`, `$prototype`, `$status`, or plain language like "run the overview."
  Autopilot: `$autopilot`.
- Claude Code: `/onboard`, `/doctor`, `/adopt`, `/overview`, `/brief`,
  `/feature`, `/debug`, `/fix`, `/tests`, `/ci`, `/implement`, `/check`, `/try`, `/audit`, `/rollback`,
  `/complete`, `/release`, `/prototype`, `/status`. Autopilot: `/autopilot`.
- Other tools: ask the agent to follow the matching `SKILL.md`.

```text
run the overview by following .agents/skills/overview/SKILL.md
```
